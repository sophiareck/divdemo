          <p>"From the blend of instrumentals to the enchanting use
            of Hozier’s voice, Wasteland, Baby! is an album that
            celebrates emotion and the wonder of music." <br> <br> -Consequence of Sound
          <br> <br> <br> <br>
          "(H)e’s got a gorgeous voice. Booming and effervescent, it’s
          an instrument that communicates passion, adventure, and wisdom" <br> <br> -Pitchfork
           <br> <br> <br> <br>
          "Hozier cultivates a more streamlined sound that really does
           benefit his voice, ranging from deep, melancholy burrs to
           bluesy howls with all the imperfections left in." <br> <br> -The Soundboard
